# üß± Vision: Bricks CMS

Bricks is a headless, developer-first CMS designed to be simple, honest, and flexible ‚Äî with no builder UI, no SaaS dependencies, and no unnecessary complexity.

## Why Bricks?

- Most modern CMS tools (Strapi, Directus, Payload) are overengineered, UI-heavy, or tied to JavaScript.
- WordPress is aging, bloated, and too tied to PHP and legacy patterns.
- Developers want to define their content like they define models: in code.
- JSON is flexible ‚Äî but sometimes you want SQL and full Django ORM power.

Bricks aims to be **Payload CMS, but in Python** ‚Äî with **the clarity of Carbon Fields**, the power of Django, and zero vendor lock-in.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who is this for?

- Developers and freelancers who want to build content APIs in minutes ‚Äî not hours.
- Agencies who deliver real websites and are done with bloated builders.
- JS devs who want a clean backend, without touching Node or PHP.
- Python devs who want to unlock the full power of Django ‚Äî ORM, DRF, migrations, auth, you name it.

Even if you're not a Django dev (yet):
If you can define a list of fields in Python, you can build your site with Bricks.

Want to go beyond content?

With Bricks, you can use the entire Django ecosystem:

- Add GDPR-compliant analytics like Matomo
- Plug in rating systems, comments, feedback flows
- Handle email submissions or payment flows
- Extend your collections with custom logic, hooks, or queries

Why? Because you're not boxed into a black-box. It's still Django underneath.

## Philosophy

- **Code-first** ‚Üí content schema lives in Python files, not a web GUI.
- **No black boxes** ‚Üí you can trace every part of the logic.
- **Pages = JSON**, **Collections = SQL**
- **Frontend freedom** ‚Üí consume via REST API however you like
- **Open source** ‚Üí forever, always.
