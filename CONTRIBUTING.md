# Contributing to Brickheadless

Hey! Thanks for your interest in contributing ðŸ™Œ

Right now, Brickheadless is a solo project under active development.
There is no formal roadmap or team â€“ but you're welcome to open issues or PRs if you think something could be improved.

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused if possible.
- If you're adding a new field type, please open an issue first so we can discuss it.
- Don't worry about being perfect â€“ clarity and function matter more than polish.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## I'm not a Git expert (yet)

Please be kind if I mess something up in reviews or merges ðŸ˜‰
This project is evolving and so am I.

Thanks again for showing interest â€“ and happy hacking!
